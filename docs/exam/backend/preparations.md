# Backend Exam Preparation

## Monday - SP-2 review

**09:00 - 11:00 - Review of SP-2 - Online**

Meet with your team and regular Monday review teacher and review the SP-2 assignment. If you have worked on SP-2 in
a different team configuration, then join the team you worked with on SP-2 this Monday, and show up where the most of the team members usually meet.

At the review:

- Present your vision of the project
- Give a brief status of how far you have come
- Show your database ERD
- Make a small demo of your endpoints through your http files
- Run the tests (if you have managed to write some)
- Reflect on the process so far - and what you have learned
- Make a list of the things you think you need to learn and train before the exam

## Tuesday - mock exam II

**09:00 - 13:00 - Mock exam II - Home assignment**

We post a new mock exam on Tuesday. Like the one we gave you before the fall holiday. Give yourself 4 hours to solve it. You will probably not make it in 4 hours - but that is the point. You get faster by training. Solve the rest of the exercise afterwards.

You can make the mock exam at home - or at the school. Make an effort to solve it alone. You can discuss the solutions with your team afterwards.

The mock exam [will be posted here](./mockexams.md).

## Wednesday

**Review of mock exam II - Online**

09:00 - 11:00 We will review the mock exam II on Wednesday in our review groups and with our regular review teacher. We will go through the solutions and discuss the problems. We will also discuss the things you need to learn and train before the exam. Hopefully, one of you will volunteer to present the solution to the rest of the class. Then we can make a "fake" exam situation.

## Thursday and Friday

**Self-study days**

Thursday and Friday are self-study days. We will be available on Discord for questions and clarifications. It is a good idea to use these days to train the things you have identified as weaknesses in your knowledge. It's also recommended to go through the mock exams again and see if you can solve them faster this time. It's the best way to prepare.

### Bornholm

Since we have been less on Bornholm for the past weeks, there will be a session with a teacher on Campus on Thursday from 09:00 to wrap things up.
