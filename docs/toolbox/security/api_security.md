# Security Exercise

## The Process

### Register

1. The user sends a register (POST) request to the server with a username and password.
2. The server checks if the username is taken.
3. If the username is taken, the server returns an error.
4. If the username is not taken, the server creates a user and returns a JWT token.

### Login

5. The user sends a login (POST) request to the server with a username and password.
6. The server checks if the username and password are valid.
7. If the username and password are valid, the server returns a JWT token.
8. If the username and password are invalid, the server returns an error.

### Authenticate

9. The user sends a request to a protected endpoint with the JWT token in the header ('Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token).
10. A `before` filter calls the `authenticate` method in the SecurityController and check if the token is valid
11. If it is valid the user is added to the context as an attribute and the request is passed on to the endpoint.
11. If the JWT token is valid, the server checks if the user has the required roles to access the endpoint.
12. If the JWT token is invalid or missing, the server returns an error.
13. If the user doesn't have the required roles, the server returns an error.

## Part 3 Protect Endpoints

- Create an endpoint that can only be accessed by authenticated users with a role of ADMIN.
  - The endpoint should return an error if the JWT token is invalid.
  - The endpoint should return an error if the JWT token is valid but the user doesn't have the ADMIN role.
  - The endpoint should return the protected resource if the JWT token is valid and the user is authorized.
- Add more endpoints so that there are endpoints for only USER and only ADMIN roles and endpoints that are open to all users.

## Part 4 Testing

- Use Rest Assured, JUnit 5, and Hamcrest matchers to test all the finished endpoints.
  - Test protected Endpoints by storing a valid JWT token in a variable and use it in the test.
Below security exercise builds on the previous weeks Rest project. Either use the Hotel project from last week or create a new Rest project to your liking. Then apply Register, Login, Password hashing, and JWT security to the project as specified below.

- [Code snippets](../../setup/securityCode.md)
Use an existing Rest project from last week or create a new one. Now add security and Rest Assured tests to the project.

## Part 1 Hashing Passwords

- Create a `User` Entity and a `Role` Entity with `ManyToMany` relationship between them
- Let the `User` implement an interface with like this one:

```java
public interface ISecurityUser {
    Set<String>  getRolesAsStrings();
    boolean verifyPassword(String pw);
    void addRole(Role role);
    void removeRole(String role);
}
```

- Create a UserDAO that implements the following interface:

```java
public interface ISecurityDAO {
    User getVerifiedUser(String username, String password) throws ValidationException; // used for login
    User createUser(String username, String password); // used for register
    Role createRole(String role);
    User addUserRole(String username, String role);
}
```

- Use bcrypt to hash the password before storing it in the database.
  - bcrypt link: <https://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/>
  - add pom.xml property: `<jbcrypt.version>0.4</jbcrypt.version>`

      ```xml
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.mindrot</groupId>
          <artifactId>jbcrypt</artifactId>
          <version>${jbcrypt.version}</version>
        </dependency>
      ```

- Hint: Hash the password in the User constructor: `BCrypt.hashpw(userPass, BCrypt.gensalt());`

- Hint: Verify the password in the UserÂ´s verifyPassword method: `BCrypt.checkpw(password, this.password);`

## Part 2 Login and Register Endpoints

- Create a SecurityRoutes class with the following routes:
  - POST /register  // returns a JWT token
  - POST /login     // returns a JWT token

## Create a SecurityController

- Create a SecurityController that implements the following interface methods:

```java
Handler login(); // to get a token after checking username and password
Handler register(); // to make a new User and get a token
Handler authenticate(); // to verify that a token was sent with the request and that it is a valid, non-expired token
boolean authorize(UserDTO userDTO, Set<String> allowedRoles); // to verify user roles
String createToken(UserDTO user) throws Exception;
UserDTO verifyToken(String token) throws Exception;
```

- You will need these dependency in pom.xml file with various JWT utility classes:

    ```xml
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.Hartmannsolution</groupId>
        <artifactId>TokenSecurity</artifactId>
        <version>${token.security.version}</version>
      </dependency>
    ```

- And this property: `<token.security.version>1.0.4</token.security.version>`

- You also need to add this to the pom.xml file just after the properties:
  
    ```xml
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>jitpack.io</id>
          <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
    ```

    The jitpack.io repository is where the TokenSecurity library is located. It is not in the Maven Central Repository.

## Update the ApplicationConfig

- Add a SecurityFilter, that looks to see if the user has the correct roles to access the endpoint:

```java
app.beforeMatched(ctx -> { // Before matched is different from before, in that it is not called for 404 etc.
  if (ctx.routeRoles().isEmpty()) // no roles were added to the route endpoint so OK
      return;
  // 1. Get permitted roles
  Set<String> allowedRoles = ctx.routeRoles().stream().map(role -> role.toString().toUpperCase()).collect(Collectors.toSet());
  if (allowedRoles.contains("ANYONE")) {
      return;
  }
  // 2. Get user roles
  UserDTO user = ctx.attribute("user"); // the User was put in the context by the SecurityController.authenticate method (in a before filter on the route)

  // 3. Compare
  if(user == null)
      ctx.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
        .json(jsonMapper.createObjectNode()
        .put("msg", "Not authorized. No username was added from the token"));

  if(!SecurityController.getInstance().authorize(user, allowedRoles)) {
      // throw new UnAuthorizedResponse(); // version 6 migration guide
      throw new ApiException(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN.getCode(), "Unauthorized with roles: " + user.getRoles() + ". Needed roles are: " + allowedRoles);
  }
});
```
