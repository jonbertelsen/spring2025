## Exercise Overview

## Instructions

3. [Create a team of 4 people in Moodle](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=729403)

### 2. Set up the development environment (one per team of 2 x 2)

1. **ONE** team member should create a new project in IntelliJ IDEA. You might want to use our custom made template - since all the nuts and bolt are already in there. If you don't have the template, you can download it from [here](../../toolbox/ides/intellij/custom_templates.md)
6. Create a new branch: `develop` and Protect the `main` branch and the `develop` branch from pushing directly to it. Only allow Pull Requests to merge into these branches.
7. Every team member should clone the new repository to their local machine
8. Checkout the develop branch (each member)

### 4. The assignment

You are going to work on a public Movie Data Base API. The rest of the assignment will continue on this page with [The Move Data Base API Exercise](./tmdb_exercise.md). Take it slow and read the instructions carefully. And also, remember to have fun!
