# Agenda for review session

We will use the Friday exercise as the starting point

## Kick-off (00:00)

## For each team

## Break-out session (00:05)

We create break-out rooms with 3-4 students in each. Randomly picked.

Each student will do:

1. Give a status of far you have come
2. Give a short demo of your solution
3. Reflect on the challenges you have met and things you would improve in the code

Together:

Think to questions you would like to get ask - and get clarifications on - when the teachers show up

### 3. Teacher visit (beginning 00:20)

Thomas and Jon will visit all breakout room

- 00:20 Team 1 + 5
- 00:30 Team 2 + 6
- 00:40 Team 3 + 7
- 00:50 Team 4 + 8

There will be some "waiting time" when either waiting for the teacher to join - or after. So in those "idle" moments, each break-out team should do this:

### 4. In-between times

If you are not done with sharing your solutions on the Friday exercise - continue - and go more into depth.

The rest of the time you can spend on this:

**Exam question prepping**

The Frontend-exam consists of questions you should be able to explain and show small coding solutions to - that you have done yourself. These are all questions that we have used before.

1. What is a Reac Component?
2. Explain the benefits of using components compared to how you would build a web application in
vanilla javascript.
3. What is a callback function in JavaScript and when would you use one?
4. What is JSX? Provide an example.
5. How does JSX differ from HTML?
6. What are the purposes and differences between the package.json and package-lock.json files?
7. Describe the purpose of props in React.
8. What is the purpose of the window object in JavaScript?
9. Explain the concept of event bubbling in JavaScript.
10. What is the scope of a variable in JavaScript? Explain the difference between global and local scope.
11. What is the spread operator in JavaScript and how does it differ from the rest operator?

The break-out team should spend "idle-time" working on these questions. Try not to rely too much on ChatGPT - and aim for some real understanding - instead of just copy/paste answers.
