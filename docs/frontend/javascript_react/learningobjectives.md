# Learning Objectives for Javascript and React Intro

## JavaScript and Webdevelopment

### JavaScript as a programming language

1. **Transition to JavaScript Syntax:**
   - Identify and translate Java concepts (e.g., `classes`, `methods`) to JavaScript syntax.
   - Understand key differences like `dynamic typing` and `prototypal inheritance`.
   - Data Types:
     - Identify and use JavaScript's primitive data types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`).
     - Identify and use JavaScript's complex data types (`object`, `array`, `function`).
     - Understand the difference between primitive and complex data types.
     - Understand the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
     - Be able to explain the concepts `compiling`, `transpiling`, and `interpreting` code.

2. **Functional Programming Concepts:**
   - Apply functional programming concepts in JavaScript, leveraging higher-order functions and immutability. This includes the use of `lambda expressions`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.
   - Recognize and exploit the benefits of functional programming in real-world scenarios.

3. **Object-Oriented JavaScript:**
   - Translate Java's object-oriented principles to JavaScript, emphasizing prototypes and object composition.

### Javascript in a browser

4. **Understand difference between Single Page Application (SPA) and Multi page**
   - Understand the concept of SPA vs server rendered pages
   - Understand how JSON is used to transfer data between client and server

5. **DOM Manipulation:**
   - Apply efficient DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript.
   - Optimize code for minimizing reflows and repaints.

6. **Integration with Web APIs:**

- Integrate JavaScript with Web APIs using:
  - fetch (only GET this week)
  - document.getElementById() / document.querySelector()
  - element.innerHTML
  - element.addEventListener()
  - element.setAttribute() / getAttribute()
  - localStorage

7. **JavaScript Debugging Proficiency:**
    - console.log()
    - Master browser developer tools for JavaScript debugging.
    - Be able to identify and resolve common JavaScript errors.

## React intro

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
    - Initialize and run a React project
    - Understand the concept of components in React.
    - Create and use functional components and understand class components.

2. **JSX Syntax:**
    - Compose UI elements using JSX syntax.
    - Grasp the relationship between JSX and JavaScript.
    - Include CSS in project

3. **State and Props:**
    - Differentiate between state and props.
    - Implement stateful components and pass data through props.
