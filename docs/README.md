# DAT 3. semester

The actual running of the 3rd semester takes place via Moodle. This means that on Moodle you can see the schedule and what is being worked on when. Most of the content is located here on GitHub. We have chosen to do this because many of the materials contain code snippets that GitHub can reproduce with syntax highlighting and the ability to copy the content. This saves us all a lot of time and effort.

A nice thing about these GitHub pages: there's a search function, so you can quickly find what
you are looking for. Just type in the search box at the top of the page.

And as a final touch, we've built a customGPT AI model,
which you can freely ask for help. It's not perfect, but it should be able to help you. You can find it [here](https://app.customgpt.ai/projects/38881/ask-me-anything?embed=1&shareable_slug=0524389955e4d02b57f2c12aca4fff50)
