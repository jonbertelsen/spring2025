refers to an IntelliJ template that a student has made. The template contains a projects setup with HibernateConfig and pom.xml ready made. Fast food for the people ;-) However, the link given in the video is not active anymore. But use [these instructions instead](../toolbox/ides/intellij/custom_templates.md#example-template-for-jpa).
