# Friday exercise: Hotel API Security

Our German developer team think in terms of quality AND security. Hence, we've been tasked with adding a security layer to the Hotel API project, so we can meet the usual standards.

Based on your code from last week (Hotel API), you should now add **security** to the project. This means adding **Register and Login endpoints, Password hashing, and JWT security** to the project.

- In class we have been working on a project that is similar to this one (Poems). You can find the code here:

- [Poems API](https://github.com/jonbertelsen/poems/tree/security?tab=readme-ov-file#security-branch)

You can clone a specific branch like this:

      git clone --branch security https://github.com/jonbertelsen/poems.git

- In case your own hotel api is not up'n running, you can clone this one:

      https://github.com/jonbertelsen/hotel_api 

  and make it your own.

Viel Gl√ºck with securing the site! üçÄ
