# Codelab Hotel API Test

This CodeLab exercise is designed to help you practice testing RESTful APIs. For today we will work in pairs of 2. You will help each other testing DAO methods and endpoints. Hopefully you will also get some experience with sharing code with each other through GitHub to speed up writing tests in parallel. It will take some time before you can push the first commit to Github, because you need to set up the project, the database, and the tests firsts.

## 1. The assignment

We will continue working on the Hotel API from last week. Follow this link to find the rest of the assignment: [Hotel API Test](./hotel_test.md).

## 2. Sign up on Moodle

[Create small teams of 2 in Moodle](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=734503).
This is mainly for the teachers to be able to check attendance, and for you to get study points. What's not to like ;-)
