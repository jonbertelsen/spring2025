# Learning Objectives REST Test and Security

## Rest Assured

- Be able to explain and demonstrate how one can test RESTful API's with Rest Assured.
- Write basic API tests to verify endpoints' CRUD functionality and response status codes.
- Demonstrate how to use a variety of Hamcrest matchers to write expressive assertions in Rest Assured tests.
- Explore and demonstrate techniques for handling authentication and authorization in Rest Assured tests.

## JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

- Explain the concept of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and its role in securing RESTful web services.
- Show how to generate JWTs for user authentication and authorization.
- Explore and explain the components of a JWT, including the header, payload, and signature.
- Show how to implement JWT-based authentication and authorization in a Javalin application.
- Demonstrate how to secure REST endpoints using JWTs to control access to resources.
- Optional: Show how to handle token expiration and token refresh mechanisms for long-lived sessions.

## Password Hashing

- Explain why password hashing is important in securing user credentialsd, and how it works.
- Implement password hashing and salt generation in a Javalin application using bcrypt.
- Develop user registration and authentication mechanisms with secure password handling.
- Demonstrate how to handle password change and reset procedures securely.
- Identify and mitigate common password-related vulnerabilities, such as brute force attacks
and rainbow table attacks.
